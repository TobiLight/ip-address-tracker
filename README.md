## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - programming language
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - "Next Generation Frontend Tooling"
- IP Geolocation API URL: [ipify API](https://geo.ipify.org/)
- Mobile-friendly interactive maps API URL: [Leaflet API](https://leafletjs.com/)

### What I learned

- How to deal with two different API to get mt web app done
- How to deal with Vite + vanilla typescript template
- How to manage adding and removiing event listeners
- How to use environment variables to hode API keys
- How to place my data panel above the map - set map container z-index: 0

### Continued development

I still find it tricky to use environment variables when deploying apps on different servises.
I'm going to finish another couple of FE challenges to polish my skills in layout and development.


I'm thankful to [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) and folks making such a nice open source: https://geo.ipify.org/ and https://leafletjs.com/
